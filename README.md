# TDD Calculator

This is a basic calculator implemented in Ruby and tested with RSpec. It has five methods:

* `add`: adds two numbers
* `subtract`: subtracts two numbers
* `multiply`: multiplies two numbers
* `divide`: divides two numbers
* `modulo`: returns the remainder when dividing two numbers

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you will need to have RSpec installed. You can install RSpec by running `gem install rspec` in your terminal.

Once RSpec is installed, you can run the tests by navigating to the project directory in your terminal and running `rspec`. The tests will then be executed and the results will be printed to the terminal.

## Adding your own tests

You can add your own tests to this project by writing them in the `spec/calculator_spec.rb` file. You can use the existing tests as a guide for how to write tests using RSpec.

For more information on how to use RSpec, you can refer to the [RSpec documentation](https://rspec.info/documentation/).
